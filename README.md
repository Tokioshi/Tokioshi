# Hey Hoy, it's me!

I'm Tokioshy (Please read it Tokioshi not Tokioshay, don't you think that is weird?). I'm a high school student from Indonesia. I learned about the programming world when I was in middle school. The first language I ever try is JavaScript. I made a bot Discord with Discord.js for the first project. I like to eat, watch anime, type, play games, listen to music, and sleep every day. I'm 17 years old right now. Is that a legal age...?
