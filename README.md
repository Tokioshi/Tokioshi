# Hey Hoy, it's me!

I'm Tokioshy (Please read it as Tokioshi, not Tokioshay. Don't you think that sounds weird?). I'm a human, born in Indonesia. I learned about programming when I was in middle school. The first language I ever tried was JavaScript. My first project was a Discord bot using Discord.js. I like eating, watching anime, typing, playing games, listening to music, and sleeping every day. I'm 18 years old now... And unemployed.
