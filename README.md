# Hey Ho!

I'm Tokioshy (Please read it Tokioshi not Tokioshay). I was in the high school. I know programming world when I was in the 2 grade of middle school. When I was interested about Discord bot and wanted to made it. When I scrolling over the YouTube vidoes, I found a video that made a tutorial how to make a bot Discord. From there until now,  I'm stuck in the middle of the programming world. Oh god...
