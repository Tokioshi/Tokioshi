# Hey Hoy, it's me!

I'm Tokioshy (Please read it Tokioshi not Tokioshay, don't you think that is weird?). I'm a highschool student from Indonesia. I've know about programming world when I was in the middle school. The first language I ever try is JavaScript. I made a bot Discord with Discord.js for the first project. I'd like to eat, watching anime, typing, playing games, listening to music, sleep everyday. I'm 17 years old right now. Is that a legal age...?
